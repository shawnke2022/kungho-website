<h3>CEO's Message on H1 2025 Report</h3>
<p class="summary">In the first half of 2025, two developments in the global AI landscape strongly reinforced our investment thesis.</p>
<button onclick="toggleText('post1')">Read More</button>
<div class="full-text" id="post1">
<p>First, Meta’s hiring disclosure revealed that over half of the world’s most sought-after AI researchers are of Chinese origin. Second, the sudden rise of DeepSeek proved that China’s large language models can now stand shoulder-to-shoulder with their U.S. peers. Remarkably, most of DeepSeek’s 170 researchers had no prior U.S. academic training. They came from the “pandemic cohort” — PhD students who, between 2020 and 2022, were unable to study in the U.S. but went on to achieve world-class breakthroughs at home. By 2023, flows of top Chinese students to leading American universities resumed.
Together, these events validate a conviction we have long held: China’s most undervalued asset is its talent. The
market is now beginning to reprice Chinese-origin AI talent, closing a gap that has persisted for too long.

Guided by this conviction, Kungho Fund has deepened partnerships with Chinese professors at leading Boston
universities. In August, we co-hosted our first joint seminar with MIT’s Han Lab, introducing PhD students to entrepreneurship and negotiation. This early engagement not only builds their business readiness, but also positions us to access the first rounds of tomorrow’s transformative AI ventures.

Looking ahead, we remain committed to uncovering undervalued opportunities at the frontier of AI — turning
unique insights into enduring value for our partners.

<h3>CEO's Message on DeepSeek</h3>
<p class="summary">Since our first report in 2023, we have been emphasizing our insistence on investing in excellent entrepreneurs + the suitable application scenarios + unique data + operating in a way that takes full advantage of the U.S. and China.</p>

<p>DeepSeek's recent release has garnered a lot of attention in the AI space, and is seen as an innovation that could potentially disrupt the existing AI landscape. Through efficient model architecture, it significantly reduces computation and storage requirements while maintaining performance; and through optimization of the pre-training corpus, it achieves the goal of low-cost, fast training of large AI models.The emergence of DeepSeek questions the traditional AI company's high-input, high-calculation R&amp;D model, prompting the industry to re-examine its resource allocation and technology strategy.

A closer look at DeepSeek reveals the following characteristics:
DeepSeek employs 140 people, all of whom are Chinese. This indicates the iceberg of the Chinese talent pool in the AI industry.
The CEO of DeepSeek is a geek with a Master’s degree in CS, indicating that the founder's love for AI technology is an important success factor.
DeepSeek has the engineering capability of tuning ultra-large scale (10,000) GPUs deployments. This indicates that engineering capability is also a key success factor.
DeepSeek is located in Hangzhou, near Alibaba’s HQ, which obviously suggest that DeepSeek also benefits from the spillover effect of engineering skills and talent from China's Internet industry.

Because of DeepSeek's impact on the industry, we are even more convinced that it won’t be long before unicorns emerge in large numbers by the outstanding Chinese AI entrepreneurs in the US, and it's the right time to invest now.

<h3>MatheGPTPro, KungHo Fund’s latest portfolio startup, successfully made their name on the list of YCombinator W24.</h3>
<p class="summary">MathGPTPro <a href="https://info.mathgptpro.com" target="_blank">https://info.mathgptpro.com</a> is a personalized learning platform that boosts student learning and teacher productivity with AI. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tianwei-yue" target="_blank">Tianwei Yue</a>, the CEO and founder said: "AI is capable of many things effortlessly, while humans need to go through a learning curve for every task. How shall we survive given rapidly changing technology? …</p>

<div class="full-text" id="post2">
<p>Learning how to think and adapt is the key. We encourage both students and teachers to embrace AI as a tool to get inspiration and boost productivity. We believe AI will bring education to the next level. We want to dismantle educational barriers, we are envisioning a future where quality, affordable, and personalized learning experiences are accessible to all people at any time.”

<h3>New Trend: Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p class="summary">ChatGPT3.5 was released in November 2022, the ground-break LLM technology have brought a new wave of AI innovation never seen before. Over the past few months, new hardware, new algorithms, new API, new models, new apps, and new platforms have been invented and introduced at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<button onclick="toggleText('post3')">Read More</button>
<div class="full-text" id="post3">
<p>We believe that LLM technology, which changes the way machines process information, will certainly change the human-machine relationship, thus offering the possibility to fundamentally change the human-human relationship, which means the ways we learn, work, collarabrate, communicate and organize. This wave of opportunity has the potential to set off a more profound and radical change in industry and society than the mobile Internet did 10 years ago.
In terms of demonstrated AI technology capabilities, "AI will reinvent all business applications" has become an ongoing reality. A successful AI application must include:
Excellent algorithms (general-purpose GPT platform, OpenAI, Bard)
Computing power (cloud platforms Azure, GCP, AWS)
Exclusively owned data
Suitable application scenarios (industry applications)
Our investment opportunities are most likely to come from two directions:
Application category: supported by generic algorithms + public computing power, we want to focus on startups that have exclusively owned data and application scenarios.
Technology category: In addition, we should focus on technology teams that can absorb cutting-edge A.I. the fastest, even if their application scenarios are not yet clear. Like Tencent and FaceBook in 1996.
